# Lambda Time Calculator

## Converts Lambda Time to your timezone.

### Usage:

`/lambdatime 12 pm edt`

returns "12 Lambda Time occurs at 3:00pm EDT" 

`/lambdatime 12:30 pm edt`

returns "12:30 Lambda Time occurs at 3:30pm EDT"

If you leave off "pm/am" then it will default to 24 hour time. For example: 

`/lambdatime 5 edt` 

returns "5 Lambda Time occurs at 8:00am EDT"

To check the currect time at Lambda, simply use the command with no arguments. 

`/lambdatime`

returns "It is currently [current time] Lambda Time"
